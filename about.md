Hi, my name is [Cat](https://catzheng.com)! I am a junior undergrad studying computer science at the University of Michigan, currently on track to graduate Fall 2021. This summer I'll be returning to Facebook after interning there remotely Summer 2020, but I'm looking for internship/co-op opportunities during the 2021-2022 school year.

This website is a small project for [EECS 201](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs201/), CS Pragmatics. I am also taking EECS 482 (Intro to Operating Systems) and a couple other distribution classes this semester.

My most proficient languages are C++ and Python (very fresh, I know). I'm very interested in learning more about coding infrastructure and ML/CV.
