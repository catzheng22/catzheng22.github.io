This is a initial blog post for the `EECS 201` website advanced project. [Jekyll][jekyll-docs] was used to automate the conversion of blog posts from `markdown` files committed in the `_posts` folder to `html` files. The generated `.html` files are sourced locally on my machine and not committed to GitHub.
